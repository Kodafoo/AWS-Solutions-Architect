# Course Fundamentals and AWS Accounts

## AWS Accounts - The basics

An AWS account is a container for Identities (Users) and Resources

When creating an aws account, you provide an account name, a unique email address, and a credit card

Every AWS account has a root user. Associated with the unique email address

The account root user has full control over all of the account and any resources created within it and cant be restricted
    - This is why root user account need to be secured

Resources bill to the AWS account payment method as they are consumed

Additional Identities can be restricted using IAM Users
    - IAM Users start with no access

It can be good to create seperate AWS account for certain uses or teams

By default, all access to an AWS account & resources is denied except for the account root user

External identities can be granted access as well

> Tip - when creating AWS accounts you can take your email address and use it as an alias. youremail+production@gmail.com for example

## [Demo] Creating General AWS Account

**Create AWS Account**

1. Enter Root user email address
2. Enter your AWS account name
3. Verify your email address
4. Create the root password
5. Enter account info
6. Billing info
7. Confirm Identity - SMS
8. Support Plan
9. Complete Sign up

## Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

If your username and password is leaked, anyone can sign into your account

Adding MFA adds an additional factor so you need your username and password, as well as your MFA device

## [Demo] Securing GENERAL AWS Account

**Setup MFA**

1. Account (Top right corner)
2. Security Credentials
3. MFA > Assign MFA device > choose type
4. Scan the QR Code
5. Test by signing out and in again

## [Demo] Creating a Budget

**Creating a Budget**

1. Login as root account or account that has permissions
2. Account (Top right corner)
3. Billing Dashboard
4. Billing Preferences > Check each box
5. Budgets > Create a Budget
6. User a template > Zero spend budget
7. Name the budget > Add email address > Create budget

## Identity and Access Management (IAM) Basics

Every AWS account has an IAM database

AWS <----> IAM (Trust)

Three Different IAM Identities
1. IAM Users - Identities which represent humans or applications that need access to your account
2. IAM Group - Collection of relaated users
3. IAM Role - Can be used by AWS Service, or for granting external access to your account
    - Roles are used when you need to grant an uncertain amount of principles certain permissions

Policy
: Allow or Deny access to AWS Service
    - Policies are attached to all three IAM Identities

IAM Three Main Jobs
1. Manage Identities - an IDP
2. Authenticate - Authenticates Identities
3. Authorize - Allow or deny access to resources

IAM is provided for free

IAM is a global service

Allow or Deny its identities on its AWS account

No direct control on external accounts or users

Identity Federation and MFA

## [Demo] Adding IAMADMIN to General

Best practice is to never use the root user

1. Open IAM
    - Find IAM sign in url on the right side of the page
2. Access Management > Users > Add Users
  i. Username
    - Provide AWS Management Console
    - Create an IAM user
  ii. Set Password
  iii. Grant Permissions
    - Attach policies directly
    - "AdministratorAccess"
  iiii. Creat User

## IAM Access Keys

Access Keys are how the AWS command line tools interact with AWS Accounts

Longer term credentials

- An IAM user has 1 username and 1 password
- An IAM user can have two access keys
- Access keys can be created, deleted, made inactive or made active

Access keys have two parts
1. Access key ID (Kind of like a username)
2. Secret Access Key (Kind of like a password)
    - Given both on cration
    - Can never see secret Access key again

## [Demo] Creating Access keys and setting up AWS CLI v2 tools

**Create Access Key**

1. Account (Top right corner)
2. Security Credentials
3. Create Access keys
4. CLI
5. Description
6. Download CSV file

**Install AWS CLI v2**

1. Visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html
2. Install the tool

```cli
aws

aws --version

aws configure --profile profile-name

# Enter AWS Access Key ID
# Enter AWS Secret Key
# Enter the default region

# lists all s3
aws s3 ls 

# this will list s3 with the profile we created
aws s3 ls --profile profile-name
```
