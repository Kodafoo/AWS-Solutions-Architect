# AWS Fundamentatls

## AWS Public vs Private Services

AWS has two types of services
1. Public
2. Private
    - These are in terms of networking

- AWS has Public and Private zones
- The public zone is where AWS hosts their public infrastucture
- The private zones are where private resources are kept. Also known as VPCs

## AWS Global Infrastructure

Regions
: Geographic separation
    - 1 Fault Domain

- Geopolitical Separation - Different governance
- Location control - Performance

- Region code - AP-Southeast-2
- Region name - Asia Pacific (Sydney)

In each region, there are multiple Availability Zones (AZs)
- AZs differentiate between each other by placing a letter at the end of the region code

Edge Locations
: Local distribution points - Less latency

Three types of service resilience
1. Globally Resilient - Every region must fail
2. Region Resilien - One region must fail
3. AS Resilient - One AZ must fail

## AWS Default Virtual Private Cloud

- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) - A virtual network inside of AWS

- A VPC is within 1 account and 1 region
- Private and isolated unless you decide otherwise

Two types of VPC
1. Default VPC - You can only have one default VPC per reion 
2. Custom VPC - You can have many custom VPCs per region

Custom - Used more seriously
Default - Set and defined by AWS - 172.31.0.0/16 
    - /20 subnet created in each subnet

- VPCs are reionally resilient
- They are split into subnets across AZs
- Internet gateway, security group, and NACL
- Subnets assign Private IPv4 addresses

## Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics

- EC2 - VMs known as instances
- EC2 is the default for compute
- EC2 is Iaas
- Private service by default
- Uses VPC network
- For public access, VPC needs to have public enabled
- EC2 is AZ resilient
- Different instance sizes and capabilities
- On-demain billing - per second
- Local on-host storage or EBS

Instance Lifecycle
- Running
- Stopped
- Terminated - Non Reversible

|Running|
|-|
|- CPU - | - RAM - | - Storage - | Network |
| $ | $ | $ | $ |


|Stopped|
|-|
|CPU|RAM|Storage|Network|
| off | off | $ | off |

AMI - Amazon Machine Image
    - Image of EC2 Instance

AMI -> EC2 -> AMI

- AMIs have permissions which say who can use them or not
1. Public - Everyone accesses
2. Owner - Implicit Allows
3. Explicit - Specific AWS Accounts allow

- AMI contains root drive
    - C: drive in windows
    - Root in linux

Block device mapping - Determines which volumes are which

**Connecting to EC2**
- Connect useing RDP - 3389 or ssh - 22

## Simple Storage Service (S3) Basics

- Global storage platform - Regional based
- Regionally resilient
- Public service, unlimted data and multi user
- Economical and access via UI/CLI/API/HTTP
- Default Storage Service
- Objects and Buckets
- All objects in S3 are key and value pairs
    - The key is the file name, the value is the data
    - The value of an object must be 0 bytes to 5TB in space
- Data in a region never leaves unless configured
- Bucket names need to be globally unique
- Buckets can hold 0 bytes of data to unlimited
- No folder heirarchy
- Folders dont exist in S3. Keys are just prepended with a folder name

### Exam Powerup

- Bucket names are globally unique
- 3-63 Characters, all lowercase, no underscores
- Start with lowercase letter or number
- Cant be formatted e.g. 1.1.1.1
- Buckets - 100 soft limit, 1000 hard limit per account
    i. You can use prefixes to make file structure for departments
- Unlimited objects in a bucket, 0 bytes to 5TB for each object
- Key = Name, Value = Data

- S3 is an object store - not file or block
- You cannot mount an S3 bucket
- Great for large scale data storage, distribution or upload
- Great for file "Offloading"
- Input and/or output to many AWS products
- S3 is most likely the default for storage in AWS

## CloudFormation (CFN) Basics

- Tool which lets you create, delete, change AWS infrastructure consistently
- Written in YAML or JSON, they both do the same thing

The parts of a CFN template
1. AWSTemplateFormatVersion - Not Mandatory
2. Description - Free text to give description
3. Metadata - Control the UI
4. Parameters - Fields to prompt user for input
5. Mappings - Key/Value pairs which can be used for lookups
6. Conditions - Create conditions to decide
7. Outputs - Outputs from the template being applied

- Template creates logical resources based off of what is defined in the template. Cloud formation then builds physical resources matching those logical resources
- CloudFormation keeps the logical and physical resources in sync

For resources there is a type and properties
type: AWS::EC2::Instance
properties:
    imageID
    instanceType
    keyname

- The logical resources are created in a stack

## Cloudwatch (CW) Basics

Cloudwatch - Collects and manages operational data

Cloudwatch has 3 main jobs
1. Metrics - AWS Products, Apps, On-Premises
    i. cloudwatch agent may be needed for on-premise or to monitor additional metrics
2. Cloudwatch logs - AWS products, app, on-premise
3. Cloudwatch events - AWS Services and schedules

- Cloudwatch data can be viewed from console, cli. Can be used in alarms take actions such as autoscaling

- Namespace = container for metrics
- All AWS data goes into "AWS/Service"
- Metrics - CPU Usage, network, in/out, disk I/O
- Time ordered set of data points

Data point
1. timestamp
2. value of metric

- Metrics can hold datapoints from many servers
- Namespace holds metrics
- Datapoint also sends in dimentions
    i. Dimensions may give isntance ID and type

metrics -> Alarms -> Alarm! -> SNS or action
             \/
             Ok

## [Demo] Simple Monitoring with Cloudwatch

1. Cloudwatch > All Metrics
2. Create Alarm
3. EC2 > Per-instance > CPU Utilization
4. Condition Set
5. Notification if you'd like
    - lambda action
    - auto-scaling action
    - EC2 action
    - session manager action

## Shared Responsibility Model

Customer
1. Customer Data
2. Platform, Applications, IAM
3. Operating Systen, Network, Firewall Config
4. Client-side, Server-side encryption
5. Data encryption, Networking traffic
6. Integrity & Authentication, Protection

AWS
1. Software
2. Compute, Software, Database, Networking
3. Hardware/AWS Global Infrastructure
4. Regions, Availability Zones, Edge locations

## High-Availability vs Fault-Tolerance vs Disaster Recovery

1. High Availability - Aims to ensure an agreed level of operation performance, usually uptime, for a higher than normal period
    - Maximizing systems online time
2. Fault Tolerance - Is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some (one or more faults within) of its components
    - Operating through failure
3. Disaster Recovery - A set of policies, tools and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human induced disaster
    - What happens after fault tolerance and HA doesnt work
    - Keep the crucial and non-replacable parts running after a disaster

- High Availability - Minimise any outages
- Fault Tolerance - Operate through Faults
- Disaster Recovery - Used when these dont work

## Route53 (R53) Fundamentals

Route53 is a managed DNS service

- 2 Main service
1. Register Domains
2. Host Zones ... Managed Nameservers
    - Global service ... single database
    - Globally resilient
- Can register domains

- Iana manages Root zones in DNA
- Route53 has relations with each company/org that has root zones
- Zone file - Database which contains all DNS information for a particular domain
- Route53 allocates nameservers for the zone servers that are distributed globally

**Register Domains**

- Relations with all major domain registries

When a domain is registered in Route53
1. R53 checks with registry (Top Level) to see if the domain is available
2. Route53 creates a zonefile for the domain being registered
    i. Zonefile is a database which contains all of the DNS information for a certaim domain
3. R53 allocates nameservice for this Zone
    i. servers which R53 creates and manages are globally distributed
    ii. Generally 4 name servers for one individual zone
4. Takes the hosted zone file and puts it onto the four managed name servers
5. Talks to the registry and adds these four name server records into the zone file
6. The registry add the four servers as NS records which act as the wuthoritative for the domain

R53
- Manage zonefiles - known has hosted zones because they are hosted on AWS Managed name servers
- When a hosted zone is created a number of servers are allocated and linked to that hosted zone
- Hosted zones can be public or private
    - Public is in AWS public network zone
    - Private is linked to a vpc
- Hosted zones stores records

## DNS Record Types

NS Records - record types which allow delegation to occur in DNS
A Records - IPv4 address hostname resolution
AAAA Records - IPv6 address hostname resolution
CNAME Records - Host to host record. Use it as an alias for a domain
    - Cannot point to other IPs only names
MX Records - Points to a mail server for a domaiin
TXT Records - Add arbitrary text to a domain
    - Used to prove domain ownership

- TTL - How long that specific record can be cached for
    - Specified on DNS records

Authoritative answer if you get your DNS query answered from the NS
Non-authoritative answer if the DNS was read from cache

- 12 large organizations manage the 13 root DNS servers
- IANA Manages the root DNS zone
- A registry is what manages TLD Zones
- A registrar is what talks with a registry to buy a domain
